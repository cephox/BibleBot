# BibleBot
BibleBot is a multi-functional Discord Bot that can send verses from the Bible.

# Invite Link
[This](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689383347545440313&permissions=522304&scope=bot) is the invite link to add the Bot to your Server.

Although it is most of the time offline, if the first full-release comes out, you'll be one of the first ones to use it.
